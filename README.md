Hey, I'm Aleksandr (ernado) Razumov, writing software mostly in go 
starting from 2014.

* Maintainer of [golangci-lint](https://github.com/golangci/golangci-lint), popular linter runner for go
* Author of [gortc](http://github.com/gortc/), WebRTC-related protocols 
in go (useful low-level parts like fast STUN/TURN protocol implementation merged to [pion](https://github.com/pion), great WebRTC stack implementation)
* Contributor to multiple opensource projects including go itself ([helped](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/25009) with nasty http2 client [bug](https://golang.org/issue/32441))
* Author of [st-l10n](https://github.com/st-l10n), localization automation toolset for hardcore space station simulator video game.

I'm working at [mail.ru](https://corp.mail.ru/en/) on video on demand platform 
as Engineering Manager.
